# Heist 2: Michael's Budget Banditry

## Mission Name: "Keeping the Bank in Check" ðŸ’°ðŸ””

### Mission Briefing

In this heist, youâ€™re stepping up your game and tackling a critical part of any AWS operation: **cost management**. Itâ€™s time to ensure you're not blindsided by unexpected charges. By setting up **billing alarms**, **budgets**, and **notifications**, youâ€™ll be able to keep your AWS spending in check and avoid any unwanted surprises.

Your mission is to create a fully automated **billing alert system** using Terraform. Youâ€™ll set up **CloudWatch billing alarms** to notify you when your charges approach **$10**, and configure **AWS Budgets** to alert you when you're nearing your monthly budget.

### Objectives:

- [ ] **SNS Topic**: Set up an SNS Topic that will send email notifications for billing alerts.
- [ ] **CloudWatch Billing Alarm**: Create a CloudWatch Billing Alarm that triggers when your accountâ€™s charges exceed $10.
- [ ] **AWS Budgets**: Configure a budget with alerts when you hit 80% of your monthly spending limit.
- [ ] **Notifications**: Verify that all alerts are sent to your email via SNS.

### Required AWS Services:
- Simple Notification Service (SNS)
- CloudWatch (Billing Alarms)
- AWS Budgets
