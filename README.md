# CODE THEFT AUTO

Welcome to **CODE THEFT AUTO**, a Terraform-based cloud infrastructure series inspired by the chaotic world of Grand Theft Auto V. Each "heist" simulates a unique cloud scenario where we provision AWS resources using Terraform, with guidance from the characters you know and love: Trevor, Michael, Franklin, and Lester. Whether you're a beginner just starting out or you've dabbled in Terraform and AWS before, this series is designed to help you level up your skills, explore cloud concepts, and, most importantly, have fun while doing it.

## 📚 Prerequisites for the Heists

Before you join the crew and take on your first cloud infrastructure heist, make sure you're ready to roll with the following:

- 🔍 **Basic knowledge of cloud computing**: Don’t worry, you don’t need to be Lester, but knowing your way around the basics will help you pull off these jobs.
- ☁️ **An AWS account**: A free-tier account is all you need to get started on these missions. (Don’t forget to set it up before the cops show up!)
- 🛠️ **Terraform installed**: Make sure Terraform is up and running on your machine before the heist begins. [Installation Guide](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli)
